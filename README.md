# Web-Clicker
Web-Clicker is simple js code to click on any links that meet the parameters you pass in

## How to use
You must have your browser allow pop ups in order for this to work properly<br>
Paste the script into your web browsers console and answer the prompts that show up on screen <br>
Below is an example of how to pass data into the prompts<br>
```txt
  park,joust,defender,mercs,ikari,galax,turtle,simpson,golden,pac,rally,crisis,burner,outrun,fighter,daytona
```
This example will search through every link on the site and check if contains any of those keywords passed in<br>
If you add in keywords to the blacklist it will skip over any links that contain those strings if it has a word in the blacklist<br>
If you choose to add a delay you choose the time in miliseconds so `3000 = 3 seconds`<br><br><br>
